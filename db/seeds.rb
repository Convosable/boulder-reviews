The standing start begins in the middle of the wall, goes up and left, then heads back right with crazy, unlikely body English. Then continue right to the baffling sloper topout. A very memorable climb.",

Lean out left, onto the overhanging face, to a large flake. Finishes with an easy mantel 25 ft. off the deck. One of JTree's finest problems.",

Make a big move up and left to the big block just below the lip (the 'Boss' hold). From here, finish either up and left or up and right, same difficulty.",
